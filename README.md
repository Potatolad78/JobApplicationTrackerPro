This is a personal project that is aimed at being able to maintain a record of jobs that I have applied to while also showcasing foremost my ability to quickly learn and second my coding abilities.

Currently I have a working product that was produced in only a few days of studying and implmentation. The APIs used and SQL were unfamiliar to me at the start so this helps show my ability to quickly learn new frameworks while also using previous knowledge to bolster the effects of said framework. 

Current Features:
Full management of applications including a search function to surf through your applications.
Placement of window in center of screen and proper wrapping to size of applications.
Quick and easy use of binds to hgelp for ease of use

Currently Planned Features:
Encrytion of information <br/>
Ability to use online
Calender functionality
