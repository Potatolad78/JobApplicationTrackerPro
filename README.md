This is a personal project that is aimed at being able to maintain a record of jobs that I have applied to while also showcasing foremost my ability to quickly learn and second my coding abilities.

Currently I have a working product that was produced in only a few days of studying and implmentation. The APIs used and SQL were unfamiliar to me at the start so this helps show my ability to quickly learn new frameworks while also using previous knowledge to bolster the effects of said framework.
